<STRONG>What are this?</STRONG>
<P>Hey there, I'm Ploe. This chunk of data and logic is my website. It's an online lit-zine. A creative writing site with a twist. <STRONG>You</STRONG> submit your content. <STRONG>I</STRONG> decide whether it's good enough to feature on the front page. <IMG src="/aspie2.png" alt="built like a brick shit-house" style="float: right"> </P>
<STRONG>That's not an overly interesting twist...</STRONG>
<P>Yup, yup - but here is where it gets pretentious. Every once in a while I will cough out an editorial. A piece of writing with a certain set of vibes. It's then your turn to churn out some prose, verse, article or otherwise that compliments these vibes. Think of it as a story tag where the delivery isn't bound to a single form. We unpack our ideas and see what we end up with.</P>
<P>Unless your content gets featured it'll be purged from the site seven days after you posted it.</P>

<P>I want your pieces of writing to be thematically related, each individual piece feeding from the previous in to the next. Notions filtering through. Some class of abstract lore should form with each iteration.</P>
<STRONG>What's in it for me?</STRONG>
<P>Presently? Fuck all... But it'll be a lark. Won't it?</P>

<P>If you come across a bug or if you think of a fancy feature that'd look sweet on the site drop 'em here on the <A href="https://github.com/ploe/mij/issues">GitHub Issues</A> page. </P>
<STRONG>Development</STRONG>
<P>If you're <STRONG>that</STRONG> way inclined (that is you're a programmer/web designer) and think you can implement a feature or two feel free to clone the repo, do your dev and tell me to take a look. I'm wanting folk to get their fingerprints all over the the platform. Get your feet under the table! That's what I say...</P>
<P>The front-end stuff is in HTML and CSS and the back-end stuff is in Ruby on top of the Sinatra framework.</P>

<STRONG>Disclosure</STRONG>
<P>In the interest of being forthright I'm going to address some things I feel I need to.</P>

<P>Like everybody I'm inclined to be nepotistic, I can't help it. It's likely that I will feature an article of somebody I know over somebody I don't. If this pisses you off - hey I'm sorry!</P>
<P>At some point I'd like to compile a printed version of what appears on here. Whether it's for profit or not is to be decided... If I want to use your work for something of this calibre I will contact you directly.</P>
<P>I won't be adding adverts to the site. Unless they're for porn! I only want to peddle smut here. Nothing else is worth my time or money... (maybe whisky)</P>
