<STRONG>What are this?</STRONG>
<P>Hey there, I'm Ploe. This chunk of data and logic is my website. It's an online lit-zine. A creative writing site with a twist. <STRONG>You</STRONG> submit your content. <STRONG>I</STRONG> decide whether it's good enough to feature on the front page.</P>
<STRONG>That's not an overly interesting twist...</STRONG>
<P>Yup, yup - but here is where it gets pretentious. Each month I will start with an editorial. A piece of writing with a certain set of vibes. It's then your turn to churn out some prose, verse, article or otherwise that compliments these vibes. Think of it as a story tag where the delivery isn't bound to a single form. We unpack our ideas across this digital zine and see what we end up with.</P>
<P>Unless your content gets featured it'll be purged from the site. I want your pieces of writing to be thematically related, each individual piece feeding from the previous in to the next. Notions filtering through. Some class of abstract lore should form with each iteration.</P>
<STRONG>What's in it for me?</STRONG>
<P>Presently? Fuck all... But it'll be a lark. Won't it?</P>
