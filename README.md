## What is mij?

mij is a communal blogging platform, with a few editorial features. It is for my vanity project 'ploe.co.uk' - which is supposed to be a creative writing site.

As a platform you are free to remix and rejigger it. Feel free! Contribute features and bug fixes too. You never know what I might like.

The site is artwork as well as the work that gets featured there, it'd be nice to see the fingerprints of folk all over it. S'your call!

## Features

   - Articles uploaded to the site can either be rejected or featured
   - Rejected articles are purged from the site
   - Featured articles persist and appear on the front page
   - Users can critique each other's work - this is limited to one critique per work per user
   - Password free login, the user gets a login token sent to their email similar to what is sent when you request to reset your password from other places.

## Development

mij is currently under active Development, it isn't finished and I'm open to features and bug fixes.

If you want a fresh version of the site to play with you can get the Docker image here.

## License

mij is available under the FreeBSD license.
