Some sort of loose BBS system for folk that prefer to hack *nix

I hate fiddling with GUI's. They're not as flexible as an OS and a Bash 
prompt so instead I am going to piece together this.

It is called mij as mij sounds a little like image and initially this was
going to be an imageboard app. Now I'm not sure...

It will:

Be built on top of the file system
Render posts out of Markdown, (no GUI's)
Be written in a scripting language
Have metadata written in JSON
The view part of the MVC will be flat blobs of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Templating will be done via <!-- HTML COMMENTS -->
All over HTTPS
Should be no need for sessions, at all, apart from user remaining logged in
Allow users to post stuff
Be extensible and allow me to add more boards fairly quickly

Directory structure:

/boards/
|-> list/
    |-> meta.json
    |-> thread/
        |-> list.md
        |-> of.d
	|-> posts.md
    |-> thread2/
    |-> thread3/
|-> of/
|-> boards.../

board schema:
{
	"title": "name of board, string",
	"blurb": "description of board, string",
}
